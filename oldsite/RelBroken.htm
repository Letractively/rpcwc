Genesis2_15_17 = "The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the LORD God commanded the man, 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.' <p><b>Genesis 3:1-12</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, 'Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?' The woman said to the serpent, 'We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'' 'You will not surely die,' the serpent said to the woman. 'For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.' When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man, 'Where are you?'  He answered, 'I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.'  And he said, 'Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?'  The man said, 'The woman you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.'"

Romans5_12_21 = "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.  Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!  Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.  For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.  Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,  so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

Isaiah5_1_2 = "'Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost. Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?'"

Psalm99_9 ="Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy. <p><b>Isaiah 6:3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were calling to one another: 'Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.'"

Psalm5_4_6 ="You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.  The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong."

Psalm51_5 ="Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.<p>  <b>Matthew 15:18-19</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.'

Matthew5_21_22__27_28 = "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell...  'You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

James2_10 ="For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.<p>  <b>Isaiah 64:6-7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.  No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.  <p><b>Romans 3:19-20</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin."

John3_17_18__36= "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son... Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.'<p><b>Hebrews 10:31</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<p><b>Isaiah 6:3-5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were calling to one another: 'Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.'  At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.  'Woe to me!' I cried. 'I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.'"

The same opening chapters of the Bible that describe personal and intimate relationship of people with their Creator also tell of the tragedy of that relationship being broken by sin<A  Title="Genesis 2:15-17   The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the LORD God commanded the man, 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.'
Also see Genesis 3:1-12" href ="Javascript:popup1XL(Genesis2_15_17,'Genesis 2:15-17')"><sup>8</sup></a>.

Because of those events every one of us is a sinner, in rebellion against God, in violation of God's moral law, in danger of eternal condemnation, and in desperate need of salvation.  The Bible declares in sweeping terms:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you." (Isaiah 59:2)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
This broken relationship with God has left all of us lacking and looking - &nbsp;<B>lacking</B> in the joy and meaning of lives lived with God and <b>looking</B> for some way to fill that void.<p></font></td></tr>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Now our lives are characterized by <font color="maroon"><b>hollowness</b></font>.
