John410 = "This is love:  Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and gve is only Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."

John1_1 = "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<p><b>Mark 2:7</b><P> 'Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?'<p><b>John 8:58</b><P> 'I tell you the truth,' Jesus answered, 'before Abraham was born, I am!'"

John1_14 ="The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."

Hebrews2_14_17 ="Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil-and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people."

Hebrews4_15 ="For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet was without sin.<P><B>Hebrews 5:8-9</b><P> Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.<p><b>Romans 5:19</b><P> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous."

Philippians2_6_8 ="Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,  but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-even death on a cross!<p><b>Isaiah 53:3-5</b><P> He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.<p><b>Galatians 3:10-13</b><P> All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly no  one is justified before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by faith.' The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, 'The man who does these things will live by them.' Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'"

Colossians1_19_20 ="For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.<p><b>Colossians 2:13-14</b><P> When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross."

Ephesians1_7 ="In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace.<p><b>Hebrews 9:24-28</b><P> For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him."

Romans3_23_26 ="for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished-he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.<p><b>1 John 4:9-10</b><P> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."

Ephesians2_3_5 ="All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions-it is by grace you have been saved.<p><b>Romans 9:22-24</b><P> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath-prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?"

Ephesians1_4_7 ="For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will-to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace."

ITimothy3_16 ="Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory."

ICorinthians15_12_20 ="But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.  But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."

IThessalonians1_9_10 ="They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead-Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath."

John14_6 ="Jesus answered, 'I am he way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.'"

John3_16 ="For God so loved the world, that He gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

IICorinthians5_21 = "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

Isaiah53_10 = "Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand."

Mark10_45 ="For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.<p><b>John 10:14-15,27</b><P> 'I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me-just as the Father knows me and I know the Father-and I lay down my life for the sheep... My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.'"


Romans3_19_26 ="Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished-he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.<p><b>Romans 8:1,31-34</b><P> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,... What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died-more than that, who was raised to life-is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us."

Psalm652 = "O you who hear prayer, to you all men will come."

Everything that was needed for salvation and a restored relationship with God, which was impossible for us, <b>God Himself did</b> through the work of His Son, Jesus Christ.  The whole Old Testament speaks of God's promise of salvation and presents pictures to help us understand what God would do on our behalf.  Then in God's perfect timing:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>"But when the time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a

In order to satisfy the justice of a holy God, Jesus gave His life as a sacrifice by <b>dying on the cross</b> as a sinless substitute<A title="Colossians 1:19-20 For   God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Colossians 2:13-14&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

 When   you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ.

What is so amazing in all this is that God did this though He was in no way compelled to.  In answer to the question, "Who crucified Christ?," the ultimate answer of the Bible is:  "For <u>God</u> so loved the world He gave His only begotten Son<A title="John 3:16 For   God so loved the world, that He gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." href ="Javascript:popup1(John3_16, 'John 3:16')"  ><sup>56</sup></A>;"  "<u>God</u> made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf<A title="II Corinthians 5:21 God    made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." href ="Javascript:popup1(IICorinthians5_21, 'IICorinthians 5:21')"  ><sup>57</sup></A>;"  "It was <u>the Lord's will</u> to crush Him and cause Him to suffer<A title="Isaiah 53:10 Yet   it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand." href ="Javascript:popup1(Isaiah53_10, 'Isaiah 53:10')"  ><sup>58</sup></A>."<p>

So you see that God did not just ignore sin of those He decided to save.  Nor did He simply issue a pardon.  No, God paid for the sins of His people by sending His Son to give His life a ransom<A title="Mark 10:45 For   even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;John 10:14-15,27&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

 'I   am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me-just as the Father knows me and I know the Father-and I lay down my life for the sheep... My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.'" href ="Javascript:popup1XL(Mark10_45, 'Mark 10:45')"  ><sup>59</sup></A>  for them and to provide the righteousness (perfect obedience) required by His law so that they could be acceptable to Him<A title="Romans 3:19-26 Now   we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.
