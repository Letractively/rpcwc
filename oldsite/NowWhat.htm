There you have it, the amazing account of what God did in reconciling sinners to Himself.  Does this make sense to you?   Has the Spirit of God convicted you of your sin, convinced you of your need and of what God has done in His Son, and brought you to a place where you want to repent of your sin and trust in Christ?  If so, review what you have just read, and express to God in prayer your understanding, your repentance and your trust in His Son.<p><br>

If you do profess faith in Jesus Christ to save you from your sins and reconcile you to God, remember that it is <b><i>all</i></b> of God.  And it is in dependence upon God that you will grow and mature as His child.  God gives you several ways by which you can grow in your new relationship with Him.<p>
