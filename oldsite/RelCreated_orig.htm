<p><BR>The opening chapters of the Bible make one thing abundantly clear: we were created by the eternal God so that we might know and enjoy Him.  The Bible says that God made us in His image.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><i>"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He 
  created him; male and female He created them." (Genesis 1:27)</i></BLOCKQUOTE><p>
Being made in the image of God speaks to issues of relationship with God and of our very existence in this world.  As image bearers of God:<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of all living creatures, we alone have the <font color="maroon"><b>ability</b></font> for spiritual relationship with God.  God has endowed us with a rational intellect and a spiritual capacity to know and relate to God.  Animals don't pray.  We can and do.  Prayer reminds us of this ability for relationship.<br><br>
Like a reflection in a mirror, an image finds it true <font color="maroon"><b>identity</b></font> in the one whose image is reflected.  As ones created in God's image, we can answer the question, "Who am I?" only in relationship to God.<br><br>
<font color="maroon"><b>Meaning</b></font> in life for us is found in respect to God.  He gives direction and purpose in life.  The image of God gives us understanding of why we are here.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The image of God we bear says that we belong to God and that our lives are to understood and lived in reference to God.  The psalmist declares:
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>"Know that the Lord is God.  It is He who made us and we are His." (Psalm 100:3)</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
God's design in creation paints a picture of fullness and delight in knowing, loving and serving our Creator.<P>
