<ol><li><b>Adoration</b> (10-15 minutes). &nbsp;Here the group lifts their hearts to God in whose name they meet and whose cause they serve.  Time is spent exalting God for who He is and the great things He has done.  Something learned about God through the daily devotions or experiences of the past week may well be fuel for exaltation.  Other stimulants to such adoration could be songs, sung or read, or reading and responding to portions of God's Word that had a profound impact on those of the group.  Stimulated by one another in conversational prayer (brief prayer, building on one anothers' prayers), the group can virtually meditate aloud in the unity of the Spirit to the praise of His name.</li><p>
<li><b> Debriefing</b> (10-15 minutes). &nbsp;This portion involves reporting on God's activity since the last meeting.  We read of this practice in the book of Acts:  "On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them" (Acts 14:27).  In addition to reports on the handiwork of God the debriefing could include taking note of God's answers to prayer, in part or in whole.  Debriefing provides focus, expectancy and accountability.  We sharpen one another as we train our spiritual senses to be alert to God's workings.  Other things that might be shared in keeping with the ministry of outreach are personal or circumstantial obstacles to and struggles encountered in the work that will enable the members to support one another in prayer.</li><p>
<li><b>Intercession</b> (30-40 minutes). &nbsp;Depending on the size of the group, here the participants might divide into smaller units for prayer.  Sometimes greater openness can result from same-gender groupings.  In the prayer cells updates might be given on those who have been targeted for prayer.  After such sharing, intercession can be made for those prayer targets.  Often it is easier if a person prays for his or her own prayer targets, but that is certainly not necessary.  Other matters for prayer might be the CHOP ministry in general, the community in which the meeting is taking place, various ministries or needs, and personal and circumstantial obstacles shared in debriefing.  Again, conversational prayer is of great benefit.  During this time of prayer, silence should not be seen as something undesirable to be overcome, but as an opportunity to commune privately with the God who is present to receive the prayers of His children and servants.</li><p>
<li><b>Deployment</b> (10-20 minutes) &nbsp;As the meeting heads toward its conclusion, here the participants reconvene as a whole to lift their eyes to the harvest into which they will be heading in the days ahead as witnesses for Jesus Christ-the workplace, school, the marketplace, the neighborhood.  They move from the barracks to the battlefield as soldiers of the cross.  Goals for the coming days could be expressed and prayed for.  Ideas and encouragement can be shared.  Prayer can be offered for upcoming activities in the local church or ministry that seek to have an impact for Christ.  The meeting concludes with a season of prayer for the work and the workers of the vineyard.  Expectant prayer will proceed from prayer rich in recognition of the character of the God we entreat and recognition that we are engaged in His work.</li></ol>
