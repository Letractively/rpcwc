John410 = "This is love:  Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and gve is only Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."

Romans3_26 ="he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus."

Luke18_26_27 ="Those who heard this asked, 'Who then can be saved?'  Jesus replied, 'What is impossible with men is possible with God.'"

Ephesians2_8_9 ="For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast."

John3_3 ="In reply Jesus declared, 'I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.'<P><b>1 Corinthians 15:50</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.<p><b>Ezekiel 36:26-27</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.'"

Romans11_6 ="And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace."

Titus3_4_5 = "But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit..."

Romans9_15_18="For he says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'  It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: 'I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.' Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden."

John3_16 ="For God so loved the world, that He gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

Romans5_8_9 ="But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!"

Romans8_28_29 ="And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."

Romans9_10_13 ="Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad-in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls-she was told, 'The older will serve the younger.' Just as it is written: 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.'"

Ephesians1_4_5 ="For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will."

Deuteronomy7_7_8 ="The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt."

Genesis3_14_15 = "So the LORD God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.  And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.'"

Psalm652 = "O you who hear prayer, to you all men will come."

While we were without God and without hope in the world, separated from our Creator God in our sinfulness, unable to do anything to save ourselves from the judgment of God and consequences of our sinful rebellion, God took <b>initiative</b>.  God, the Holy One sinned against, set His undeserved, unexpected and unmerited love on sinners to save them<A title="Genesis 3:14-15 So   the LORD God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.  And  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.'" href ="Javascript:popup1(Genesis3_14_15, 'Genesis 3:14-15')"  ><sup>28</sup></a>.  Notice God's initiative in saving His people from their sins:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>"But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were yet
  sinners..." (Romans 5:8)<p>"We were by nature objects of wrath.  But because of His great love
  for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive..." (Ephesians 2:3-4)</i></p></BLOCKQUOTE><p>
God took this initiative not because His character compelled Him to or because He was constrained by anything in us<A title="Deuteronomy 7:7-8 The   LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt." href ="Javascript:popup1(Deuteronomy7_7_8,'Deuteronomy 7:7-8')"  ><sup>29</sup></a>, but only because of His own decision<A title="Ephesians 1:4-5 For   he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will." href ="Javascript:popup1(Ephesians1_4_5, 'Ephesians 1:4-5')"  ><sup>30</sup></a>.
      The Bible expresses this in three ways:</FONT></p></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><br>God set His <font color="maroon"><b>love</b></font> on sinners in the face of their rebellion
<A title="Romans 9:10-13 Not   only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad-in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls-she was told, the elder will serve the younger.  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." href="Javascript:popup1(Romans9_10_13,'Romans9 10:13')"><sup>31</sup></a>.  In the Bible God's love is an act of His will to save<A title="Romans 8:28-29 And   we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. " href ="Javascript:popup1(Romans8_28_29, 'Romans 8:28-29')"  ><sup>32</sup></a>.  God's just wrath is not the <u>contrast</u> to His love.  Rather, God's just wrath is the <u>context</u> for His love<A title="Romans 5:8-9 But   God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!" href ="Javascript:popup1(Romans5_8_9, 'Romans 5:8-9')"  ><sup>33</sup></a>.  If the dark and bleak backdrop of God's just wrath is removed, the brilliant glory and warmth of His love is dimmed.  The teaching of the Bible is that "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes on Him will not perish...<A title="John 3:16 For   God so loved the world, that He gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." href ="Javascript:popup1(John3_16, 'John 3:16')"  ><sup>34</sup></a>"  Remove the "perish" (i.e., God's wrath), and the love doesn't make any sense.</BLOCKQUOTE>

To those who deserve condemnation and eternal punishment in satisfaction of His justice, God shows <font color="maroon"><b>mercy</b></font><A title="Romans 9:15-18 For   he says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'  It  does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: 'I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.' Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden." href ="Javascript:popup1XL(Romans9_15_18, 'Romans 9:15-18')"  ><sup>35</sup></a>.  Mercy does not give a person what he or she deserves.  Mercy spares us justice.  The Bible says, "But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy.<A title="Titus 3:4-5 But   when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.  He  saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit..." href ="Javascript:popup1(Titus3_4_5, 'Titus 3:4-5')"  ><sup>36</sup></a>"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TD VALIGN="top" width="79%" ><FONT FACE="Western" size = 4><BLOCKQUOTE>If mercy does <u>not</u> give us what we do deserve, <font color="maroon"><b>grace</b></font> <A title="Romans 11:6 And   if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace." href ="Javascript:popup1(Romans11_6, 'Romans 11:6')"  ><sup>37</sup></a> gives us what we do not deserve.  To say that God's salvation is by grace means that it comes to us as a <u>gift</u>. &nbsp;It is not something we can earn by our efforts at obeying God's law or by trying to make up for the sin we have done in the past.  Salvation does not come by turning over a new leaf, but by being given a new heart, a new nature<A title="John 3:3 In   reply Jesus declared, 'I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.'&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;1 Corinthians 15:50 I   declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ezekiel 36:26-27 'I   will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.'" href ="Javascript:popup1XL(John3_3,'John 3:3')"  ><sup>38</sup></a>.  In fact, the Bible says that "it is by grace we are saved through faith, and that not of ourselves, it is a gift of God, not by good works.<A title="Ephesians 2:8-9 For   it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast." href ="Javascript:popup1(Ephesians2_8_9, 'Ephesians 2:8-9')"  ><sup>39</sup></a>" </BLOCKQUOTE>

As sinners we are unlovely and unlovable.  Yet God set His love upon sinners such as us to provide salvation and to restore that broken relationship.  But that begs the question, How can sinners possibly <A title="Luke 18:26-27 Those   who heard this asked, 'Who then can be saved?'  Jesus  replied, 'What is impossible with men is possible with God.'" href ="Javascript:popup1(Luke18_26_27, 'Luke 18:26-27')"  ><sup>40</sup></a>find acceptance and a restored relationship with a holy God<A title="Romans 3:26 he   did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus." href ="Javascript:popup1(Romans3_26, 'Romans 3:26')"  ><sup>41</sup></a>?<p>
