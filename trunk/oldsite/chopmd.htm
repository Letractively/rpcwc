<img src="chop_dev.jpg" align=left width="110" height="97">Evangelism is a kingdom mission, declaring the glorious redemption of the Savior, calling for the repentant faith of changed kingdom allegiance.  It is a spiritual activity, facing spiritual opposition, employing spiritual wisdom and weapons. The church is the kingdom's agent, local congregations outposts of the kingdom, the congregation its soldiers.<p>&nbsp;<br>

Community Houses of Prayer (CHOP) seeks to mobilize Christ's disciples for service in the extension of Christ's kingdom, emphasizing prayer that would shape us as God's instruments and accomplish His saving purposes in those around us.  As soldiers of the cross, we fight not for victory but in victory.  We enter the harvest of our worldly surroundings <I>as witness</I> for Christ intent on <I>bearing witness</I> to Him.<p>&nbsp;<br>

CHOP is a ministry tool that employs prayer as means <I>to revive</I> (motivation) our hearts in grace as we draw near to the living God as our loving Father and <I>to involve</I> (participation) us in our everyday lives as active witnesses for Jesus Christ in dependence and expectation of His working.   CHOP directs prayer so as to cultivate in us a greater <font color="maroon"><B>awareness</B></font> of the evangelistic nature of ordinary life in which we find ourselves every day.  It engenders an <font color="maroon"><B>attitude</B></font> of personal involvement and expectation as the witnesses for Christ we are by virtue of being His disciples.  It leads us in the actual <font color="maroon"><B>activity</B></font> of bearing verbal witness to the glorious gospel of salvation bound up in Christ alone.<p>&nbsp;<br>

CHOP weaves together four strands: <b>1) <font color="maroon">lifestyle evangelism</b></font>, <b>2) <font color="maroon">strategic prayer</b></font>, <b>3) <font color="maroon">personal spiritual renewal</b></font>, and <b>4) <font color="maroon">spiritual warfare</b></font>.  Participation in CHOP will not only <I>involve</I> believers in these four aspects, but will also <I>train</I> them in their use through instruction, reinforcement and practice.<p>&nbsp;<br>

<center><img src="spheres.gif" width="363" height="120"></center><p>&nbsp;<br>

Briefly surveying these four strands, <font color="maroon"><B>lifestyle evangelism</B></font> looks to share the gospel in the context of those relationships at work or at home or wherever God has providentially placed us.  <font color="maroon"><B>Strategic prayer</B></font> is kingdom prayer (i.e., prayer concerned with Christ's kingdom issues and goals) characterized by planning, intention, focus and direction.  <font color="maroon"><B>Personal spiritual renewal</B></font> reaches to matters of motivation as we are invigorated with the scent of God's grace so richly, unexpectedly and undeservedly poured out upon us.  It seeks to grow in intimate knowledge of God fueled by His revelation of Himself in His Word.  Such prayer draws us near to God, cultivating in us <I>His</I> heart for the lost, compelling our witness by love and gratitude and not by sterile duty.  <font color="maroon"><B>Spiritual warfare</B></font> takes into account the biblical data of the reality of spiritual opposition for our work of witness for the extension and strengthening of the kingdom of God against the kingdom of the prince of darkness.  This strand attempts to be biblically balanced while avoiding the pitfalls that could lead to fanciful error and excesses.

One of the goals of the Community Houses of Prayer ministry is to learn to use prayer as a <I>weapon</I> of the kingdom.  We're not all that accustomed to wielding prayer in this way.  One of the purposes of CHOP is to train in <I>kingdom</I> prayer, <I>prayer that seeks God for His purposes and not merely for our personal needs or wants</I>.  As with any tool or weapon, the more we become familiar with the way it works the more adept we will become in its use.<p><img src="wmagenda1.gif" align=right width="231" height="189">&nbsp;<p>

CHOP involves a small group of two or more believers committing themselves to a 12-week period of  <a href = "chopwm.htm">meeting together weekly</a> (using a fixed format) and <a href="choppray.htm">praying privately daily</a> (following a daily guide for seeking God and strategic prayer outreach).  The mission of the CHOP group is the common goal and mutual support in reaching others for Christ, particularly through prayer.  This prayer will <I>affect</I> the believer as God's instrument and will <I>effect</I> God's purposes in the field about that believer.
