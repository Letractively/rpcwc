

Will/Joe,

The website environments are setup.

Will can ftp the websites to the webserver the sites are on using the 
following FTP details:

for chopministry.net -
server/host before Joe changes the DNS: 12.164.82.44
server/host after Joe changes the DNS: chopministry.net
username: chopministry
password: rpcwc3366

for rpcwc.org -
server/host before Joe changes the DNS: 12.164.82.45
server/host after Joe changes the DNS: rpcwc.org
username: chopministry
password: rpcwc3366

I will send a separate e-mail regarding e-mail.

Joe,

As you likely know - all of the e-mail addresses for chopministry.net 
forward to other providers.  

We have setup the e-mail addresses in our filtering system and on 
the mail server - and the forwarding is setup.

As such, the change of the MX records will be transparent to the 
end users - and there will be no need for anyone to reconfigure their 
e-mail client settings.  And, there will not be any transition issues re: 
mail getting to them.

The MX records for chopministry.org should replace the existing MX 
records completely - and appear as follows:
chopministry.net. IN MX 100 chopministry.net.s5a1.psmtp.com. 
chopministry.net. IN MX 200 chopministry.net.s5a2.psmtp.com. 
chopministry.net. IN MX 300 chopministry.net.s5b1.psmtp.com. 
chopministry.net. IN MX 400 chopministry.net.s5b2.psmtp.com. 

They do not use the rpcwc.org domain name for e-mail - so no MX 
records should exist for that domain name.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these 
matters.

Regards,

Rich
