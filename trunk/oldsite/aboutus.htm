<FONT  SIZE=5><b>We are a People Belonging to God</b></FONT><br>The Bible makes the most remarkable statement about the church:<br><br>
<i><center>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, now you have received mercy.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Peter 2:9-10</CENTER><p>
What a beautiful statement of honor and privelege!  God has shown <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>mercy</b></FONT>, calling a people out of the darkness of sin and emptiness and bringing them into the light of His life and love.<p>
That's how we at RPC understand who we are.  We are a people who has been restored to our created <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>relationship</b></I></FONT> &nbsp; with the living and true God, the maker of heaven and earth--only because He has shown mercy on us.<p>
The Bible tells us how God did this:<br>
<center><i>But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titus 3:4-7</center><p>

<FONT  SIZE=5><b>We are a People Serving God</b></FONT><br>Just as the Bible defines our identity as a people, so it defines our agenda:<br><br><center><i>To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revelation 1:5-6</center><p>
As God's people, we want to <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>enjoy</b></FONT> the wonderful relationship with Him to which He has restored us in Christ.  But we also want to <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>serve and honor</b></FONT>&nbsp;God in every part of our lives, and carry out the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>work</b></FONT>&nbsp;He has for us as His church.<P>
For the church to serve God means a number of things. First, we need to be <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>nourished</b></FONT>&nbsp; and <FONT COLOR="maroon"> <b>directed</b></FONT>&nbsp; for service.<p>Second, we need to be trained for the work God has given us to do.  God does this nourishing, directing, and training by His Holy Spirit through the Bible, God's inspired Word, holy and without error<p>Also, we serve God in <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>community</b> </FONT>, not merely as individuals but together.  We enjoy a special relationship with one another as God's people.  God has given us to each other to love and to encourage.<p>

<FONT  SIZE=5><b>We are a People Reaching People</b></FONT><br>To be a part of RPC is to be a part of Reaching people for Christ.  For us that means one of two things.<p>For those who have never professed personal faith and trust in Jesus Christ for their salvation, to reach them for Christ means to <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>share the gospel</b></FONT>&nbsp;that they may believe that Jesus is the Savior and that by believing they may have life in Him.<p>For those who by the grace of God have turned to Christ in faith, to reach them for Christ means to help them <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>grow</b></FONT>&nbsp; in their Christian lives<p>
