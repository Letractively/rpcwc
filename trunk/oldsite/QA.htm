<B><P>    <font color="maroon">Q: </font> What exactly is sin?</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> Sin is breaking the law of God in thought, word or deed, not doing what God commands or doing   
 what He forbids. &nbsp;Jesus explained that lusting in our hearts was a violation of God’s command not to commit adultery, or hating another person broke God’s command not to murder. &nbsp;</P><B><P>&#9<font color="maroon">Q: </font> But am I a sinner?</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> The Bible says that everyone is a sinner.  We sin because we are born sinners.  &nbsp;Sin involves not only   
 our acts of disobedience, but includes our hearts that are full of sin and in rebellion against God.</P>
<B> <font color="maroon">Q: </font> But I know plenty of people worse than I am.  </P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B><FONT FACE="Western" size = 4> God’s standard is not other people. &nbsp;His standard is His own perfect holiness. &nbsp;God gives us His   
 perfect law to compare ourselves to, not other sinners. &nbsp;Jesus’ point in saying that even our thought life   
 breaks God’s law makes it clear that every one of us is a sinner and that we <U>cannot</U> be good enough to   
 measure up to God’s standard of perfection.</P>
<B> <font color="maroon">Q: </font> Won’t God give me a break if I try to be good and to obey His commandments?</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> Often we think of sin as those <I>big</I> crimes like murder, but the Bible says if we sin just one time we  
 fall short of His standard of perfection necessary for salvation and so are guilty before Him. &nbsp;And God   
 must and will punish all who are guilty at all with eternal damnation.</P>
<B> <font color="maroon">Q: </font> Isn’t that awfully severe?  It doesn’t seem fair.</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> We don’t grasp just how <U>serious</U> sin is because we don’t understand just how <U>holy</U> God is. &nbsp;God’s   
 judgment on sin is fair and just.  Not to punish sin would be to make God unjust.</P>
<B> <font color="maroon">Q: </font> Can’t I just try harder to obey God’s commandments?</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> The Bible says even our very best efforts are contaminated by our sinful hearts.  &nbsp;Also, God <U>must</U>   
 exact the justice His holiness demands for the sins we have committed.</P>
<B> <font color="maroon">Q: </font> But won’t God forgive my sins if I confess them?</P>
</B> <B><font color="maroon">A: </font></B> Yes, but not just because you confess them.  God forgives sins only through His provision for sin   
 that meets the demands of His justice and provides what is necessary to be right with Him. &nbsp;The   
 problem is how can God save sinners without compromising His holiness.</P></FONT><p><br><br>
