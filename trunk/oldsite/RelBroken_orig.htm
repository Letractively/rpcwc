<p><BR>
The same opening chapters of the Bible that describe personal and intimate relationship of people with their Creator also tell of the tragedy of that relationship being broken by sin .  This account is not only an event of history, it the story of every ordinary human being since .  Because of those events every one of us is a sinner, in rebellion against God, in violation of God's moral law, in danger of eternal condemnation, and in desperate need of salvation.  The Bible declares in sweeping terms:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you." (Isaiah 59:2)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
This broken relationship with God has left all of us lacking and looking - &nbsp;<B>lacking</B> in the joy and meaning of lives lived with God and <b>looking</B> for some way to fill that void.

<BLOCKQUOTE><img src="redball.bmp">Now our lives are characterized by <font color="maroon"><b>hollowness</b></font>.  We have lost that meaning, purpose, and identity that were part of God's design in relationship with Him.  A void exists in the very center of our beings in our separation from God by sin.  Of course, voids seek to be filled; they motivate us to fill them .  And so we try to find meaning, purpose and identity in all sorts of things-career, material possessions, money, educational degrees, appearance, athletics, religious involvement, and the list goes on.<BR><BR><img src="redball.bmp" >
We are <font color="maroon"><b>helpless</b></font> to deal with this sin that grips us.  God is holy .  He is perfectly and morally pure and cannot look upon sin . We sin because we are sinners .  We break God's law by what we do  and what we fail to do , not only in action , but even in our thoughts . There is nothing we can do, either to make up for the guilt of our past sin or measure up to God's unchanging standard of perfection.<BR><BR><img src="redball.bmp">
We are left <font color="maroon"><b>hopeless</b></font>.  Incapable of dealing with the reality of sin in our lives, we can only expect the just punishment of God upon us for our sin.  The Bible describes us as ones upon whom the wrath of God abides .  Not only are we without God and without hope in this life, the judgment seat of God looms before us at our physical death.  God's pronouncement of "guilty" and sentence of eternal condemnation hang over our heads.</BLOCKQUOTE>

What a tragic and terrifying predicament!  In our separation from God we live an awkward and anemic life in this world, trying to make the best of things, satisfying ourselves with temporary and illusory measures.  We are helpless to deal with the guilt of sin that condemns us and the power of sin that enslaves us.  We have no hope.
