John410 = "This is love:  Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and gve is only Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."

IICorinthians5_19 ="that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation."

Luke24_45_47 ="Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, 'This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.'"

Joel2_12_13 ="'Even now,' declares the LORD, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.'  Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity."

IICorinthians7_8_10 ="Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it-I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while-yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."

IThessalonians1_9_10 ="for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead - Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath."

Galatians2_16 ="know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified."

Romans1_16_17 ="I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'<p><b>Romans 4:23-25</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The words 'it was credited to him' were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness - for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.<p><b>Romans 10:9-10</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.'"

Hebrews11_1 ="Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see."

Luke9_23_26 ="Then he said to them all: 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.'"

Proverbs3_5_7 ="Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;  in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.  Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil."

ICorinthians6_19_20 ="Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body."

John10_25_28 ="Jesus answered, 'I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.'"

Acts26_20 ="First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.<p><b>James 2:17-18</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, 'You have faith; I have deeds.' Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.<p><b>1 John 2:3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands."

Titus2_11_14 ="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say 'No' to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope-the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.<p><b>Ephesians 2:10</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

Acts17_29_30 ="Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone-an image made by man's design and skill. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent."

IJohn3_23 ="And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us."

John10_10 ="I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."

Romans8_16_17 ="The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.<p><b>Titus 3:3-7</b><p>At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life."

John1_12_13 ="Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.<p><b>John 20:31</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

The good news is that God has accomplished the salvation of His people through the work of His Son, Jesus Christ.  That which we could never do, nor would we ever deserve, God did in Christ - reconciling people to Himself, not counting their sins against them<A title="2 Corinthians 5:19 that   God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation." href ="Javascript:popup1(IICorinthians5_19, 'II Corinthians 5:19')"  ><sup>61</sup></a>.  Not that that sin was ignored; quite the contrary, it was met head on in all its ugliness and violence by the Son of God for His sheep. As the Good Shepherd, Jesus says He will not lose any the Father has given Him.  Jesus says one other thing about His sheep:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>"My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow me.  I
  give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can
  snatch them out of My hand." (John 10:27-28)

God's command is to turn to His Son, Jesus Christ, and follow Him.  What is involved in following Christ?  The Bible describes three proper responses to this Jesus who is Savior of sinners and Lord of life.</FONT></p></TD></TR>

Repentance is not merely being sorry for something.  It is turning from our sinful rebellion against God, out a deep awareness of our sin and grief<A title="Joel 2:12-13 'Even   now,' declares the LORD, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.'  Rend  your heart and not your garments.

Repentance turns from any idea of being our own savior, thinking we can do something to earn salvation. It turns from being our own lord, rejecting God to follow the desires and agenda of self.</BLOCKQUOTE>

We are to repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.  This is what the Bible calls "<font color="maroon"><b>faith</b></font>."  Such faith knows the facts (about sin and where salvation is found), admits they are true, and places sole trust and confidence in God's provision for sinners - Jesus Christ<A title="Romans 1:16-17 I   am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
