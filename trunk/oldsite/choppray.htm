<hr><center>God's design for prayer is not simply for our cleansing or comfort, but for the carrying out of His purposes.  &nbsp;Prayer is communication with the living and true God. &nbsp;God inclines His ear to the prayers of His people. &nbsp;He invites and commands our prayers. &nbsp;He attaches His promises to our prayers. &nbsp;He uses our prayers. &nbsp;There is power in prayer, not simply for us but for action, not in itself but in the One it addresses. &nbsp;Prayer engages us as God's instruments.

<b><u>Seeking God</u></b><br><p>
Read Psalm 115:1-8
<ul><li>What does verse 3 tell us about the limitations of God?</li>
<li>How is God contrasted with idols?</li>
<li>God deserves glory because He is God.  But what does the psalmist particularly highlight in v.1 for praise?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Turn your eyes to your Father in heaven.  Review with Him some of the things he has just told you about Himself. &nbsp;Spend time exalting Him for them. &nbsp;Ask God to lead you as you begin this CHOP ministry. &nbsp;Are there areas you see now in your life for confession, areas where you rob God of the glory that belongs to Him?</i></blockquote>
<b><u>Strategic Prayer</u></b><br><p>
<ul><li>Pray by name for those you have targeted<a href = "javascript:popup1(f1,'')" title="Arrived at through life-sphere mapping found in Basic Training Lesson 1 in the Supplement section." ><sup>1</sup></a> for prayer over the weeks ahead by name that God would<br><ul><li>help them to know their relationship to Him as the Creator who is to be forever praised</li><li>start to work in them a dis-ease in their separation from Him in their sinful condition</li></ul></li><br>
<li>pray that God would give you opportunity to spend time with your contacts so that you can begin to build relationship with them</li>&nbsp;<p>
<li>use the following Scriptural profile<a href = "javascript:popup1(f2,'')" title="God alerts us to our enemy, the devil through his names, titles and descriptions, making us aware of his intentions, activity, tactics, schemes and character.  We can use this reconnaissance report as basis for our prayer to God against our enemy as we seek to reach out for the sake of God's kingdom."><sup>2</sup></a> to pray to the Lord against the devil's sway in your contacts' lives<blockquote>Ephesians 2:2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the <u>ruler of the kingdom of the air</u>, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.</blockquote></li><br>
<li>Pray for your CHOP co-laborers that they might grow in intimacy with God as His children, and earnestly desire that He be honored before others.</li>
